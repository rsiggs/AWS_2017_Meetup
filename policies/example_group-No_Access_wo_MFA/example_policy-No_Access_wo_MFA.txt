This policy prevents access to any actions against any S3 bucket, or any EC2 action - unless the user has authenticated with an MFA token. This could be used for any set of permissions you want to protect. The use of conditional statements - such as only requiring MFA for users coming from outside your LAN, or similar options - can be implemented depending on your specific use-case
