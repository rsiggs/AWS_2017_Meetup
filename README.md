[Brett Mitchell](linkedin.com/in/brett-mitchell-64b0122)-- IAM Intro, History, and Overview
[Roger Siggs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rogersiggs/)--  IAM User/Group/Policy Management and Best Practices

This was a nice session for the local AWS Meetup. In this session I was able to walk the attendees through an examination of some best practices for managing users within AWS IAM, some security constraints around Identity and Access, and demonstrate some tools to make enforcing things like MFA less difficult. 

Included:

 1. Identity and Access Management (IAM) - powerpoint presentation
 
 2. local_files - example of credentials file for the tool user
 
 3. policies - example policies and their respective groups for setting up basic management structure

 4. tools - sample code for MFA authentication, user creation, and aggregating multiple account information
